OMDb API
The Open Movie Database

The OMDb API is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, all content and images on the site are contributed and maintained by our users. 


Due to some security concerns on how the keys were being distributed I updated the form to email them and also changed the algorithm used, which means your older keys not obtained through email will eventually stop working. 
Please go read the post on the Patreon page about this major change.
